# AlphaProteo Trusted Tester Program Notebooks

The `ap_prepare_inputs` colab is provided as an aid to the users of the
AlphaProteo Trusted Tester Program. It can be used to prototype requests and
provides an interface to iterate on target protein regions, performing basic
validation, and visualising the selected target.

## Usage

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-deepmind/ap_trusted_testers/blob/master/ap_prepare_inputs.ipynb)
To begin, please type or paste your target PDB ID into the corresponding field,
then select "Runtime" -> "Run all" from the menu. See detailed instructions
at the top of the colab.
